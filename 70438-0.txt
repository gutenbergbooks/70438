INTRODUCTION.


Among the many and varied employments which have of late years been
opened up for women, there are few which promise to be so remunerative
and permanent as that of Printing (composing department). It is an
employment which gives scope for the exercise of the highest faculties
as well as the nimblest fingers; it requires but very little physical
strength; it is not in any way injurious to health; it can be performed
either sitting or standing; and is, at the same time, one in which
there is always a demand for employés.

This latter is a great consideration, as it is well known that many
very suitable employments for women are rendered almost unprofitable
because there is so little demand for labour in them, and so many
applicants for each situation. We have no hesitation in saying that
if women will only take up this employment with a determination
to surmount any difficulties which may appear at the outset, they
will find themselves in a few years in a position to demand such
remuneration as few other employments can offer.

It may be objected by some that women of education will not care to be
placed on the same level as journeymen compositors. This we admit, but
only in a qualified sense. They need not object to being on the same
level as regards remuneration (if they prove to be equally skilful),
and there is no fear of their being so in any other respects.

The following pages are written for the information of such as are
desirous of learning the Art of Printing. Of course they are quite
elementary, but they will give a good general idea of the _modus
operandi_.




OUTLINES OF COMPOSITORS’ WORK.


Dear reader,

If you desire to know something about the Art of Printing, suppose you
go with me on an imaginary tour of inspection round a printing office
with which I am acquainted. We will suppose that you are quite ignorant
of even the least fact connected with the business, and that you will
not mind asking me questions as we go along.

Well, here we are, in a composing-room, which contains a great many
things you have never seen before, and so, perhaps, I had better begin
to tell you their names and uses.

First we notice the _frames_ (see p. 35). These are wooden structures
on the tops of which the cases lie in a slanting position, something
like a desk. The lower part of the frame you will notice is fitted
with a rack, in which cases are kept when not in use. These allow of
the cases sliding in and out like drawers.

Next we notice the _cases_ (see p. 33). These are wooden trays, with
cross pieces forming a number of boxes or compartments, in which the
types are placed. There is an upper and a lower case. The upper has
ninety-eight compartments, and contains the capitals, small capitals,
figures, and accents. The lower case has fifty-three compartments,
and contains the smaller or “lower case” letters, points, spaces, and
quadrats.

The types in these cases are arranged so as to afford the greatest
facility in composing the letters into words. On looking at them you
will observe this--more particularly in the lower case. You will notice
that the letters required for the words most frequently recurring, such
as _and_, _the_, _this_, _that_, _there_, _them_, _then_, are placed
nearest the centre of the case, so that they are the more easily “set
up.” We will explain this process further on.

Now let us examine the _types_. These are small pieces of metal, on
the ends of which the letter is cast, and are all of a uniform height.
On the front of the stem nicks are cut, so that it is easy to see the
position of the letters as they lie in their respective boxes.

The compositor takes her place in front of the case, and works standing
or sitting, holding in one hand an instrument made of iron, called a
_composing-stick_ (see p. 34). With the other hand she takes the types
as she requires them out of the boxes; ranges them on a slip of brass,
called a _rule_, in her composing-stick, and putting a space to make a
blank between each two words, forms one line after another, till the
stick is full, when she empties it out upon the _galley_ (see p. 35). A
certain number of these lines are measured off into pages, several of
which being ranged and wedged tight in an iron frame, called a _chase_
(see p. 34), are ready for the press.

The composing-stick consists of a plate of iron about six inches long
and two inches wide. On the right side of this plate is a ledge, about
half an inch high, running the whole length of the plate, and serving
to sustain the letters, the backs of which are to rest against it;
on the same plate are placed two other lesser pieces, one of which
is contrived to slide along it, so that the two pieces may be either
approached or withdrawn at pleasure, to adjust the line to the measure
intended.

Before the compositor proceeds to compose, a rule, or thin slip of
brass plate, cut to the length of the line, and of the same height as
the letter, is placed against the ledge of the composing-stick for the
letter to bear immediately against.

Being thus prepared, the compositor, with the copy lying before her,
and the stick in her left hand, picks up with the right the letters,
spaces, &c., and places them against the rule; with the thumb of the
left hand she presses them close to the slide, and thus keeps them
tight and steady while the other hand is employed in setting in more
letters; the whole being performed with a degree of expedition not
easily imagined.

A line being thus composed, if it end with a word or syllable and fill
the measure, needs no further care; otherwise more spaces are to be
put between the several words to justify the lines, _i.e._, make the
measure quite full so that every line may end evenly; and thus she
proceeds to another line.

The spaces here used are a sort of blank, of the like dimension as the
letters, but not so high, whose faces, therefore, when set, do not
appear nor give any impression. They are of several kinds, according to
the dimensions of the whites or intervals to be made by them, _viz._,
quadrats, to fill up a break at the end of a paragraph, or the like;
em quadrats, which are square and of the thickness of an m, serving to
make the distance after a period, or between sentence and sentence;
en quadrats, of the thickness of an n, to be placed after colons,
semicolons, exclamations, and interrogations; and thick or thin spaces,
to be used between the words in justifying, as above.

The first line being completely justified, the compositor advances to
the next. In order to do this, she moves the brass rule from behind
the line and places it in front, and composes another line against it,
after the same manner as the former: and thus she goes on till her
stick is full, when she empties it into the galley in the following
manner:

Taking the rule from behind the last line, she places it before it;
with her two middle fingers she squeezes the lines in the stick close,
her two fore-fingers at the same time being applied on the outside of
the rule: she then lifts them out of the stick, and placing her thumbs
behind the first line, lifts them into the galley; taking care to
disengage her thumbs without breaking the lines.

The compositor, having set the proper number of lines in the stick, and
emptied them out into the galley, again fills and empties, as before.
When a sufficient number of lines have been composed to fill the galley
she secures it with side-stick and quoins, and having pulled a proof on
the _galley-press_ (see p. 36), hands it to the forewoman with copy for
reading.

The _corrections_ are written on the margin of the proof, right against
the line where the faults are found. There are different characters
to express different corrections, as D or δ, _dele_, for anything to
be effaced, or left out. When anything is to be inserted, the place
is marked in the line with a caret, ^, and the insertion added in the
margin. When a word, syllable, &c., is to be altered, it is erased
from the proof, and that to be put in its place written in the margin;
always observing, that if there be several mistakes in the same line
the corrections in the margin must be separated by bars, or strokes,
/. If a space be omitted, its place is marked with a caret, and the
margin with #. If a space be wrongly placed, as in the middle of a
word, the two parts are connected with a cu‿rve, and this mark ⁐ put
in the margin. If a letter be inverted, it is expressed on the margin
with ੭. If anything be transposed, it is marked thus: _The shortest
+| are the | follies+ best_; for _the shortest follies are the best_;
and in the margin is added _trs._ in a circle. If Roman characters are
to be changed for italic, or _vice versa_, a line is drawn under them
+thus+, and _Roman_ or _italic_ added in the margin; if to capitals, a
treble line. If a word or sentence is entirely omitted, the place is
marked with a caret, and the missing words written in the margin. If
the letters of a word stand too far asunder, a +~curve~+ is drawn under
them, and in the margin is put this mark ⁐.

Where the alterations are considerable, and particularly where
insertions or omissions are to be made, there usually arises a
necessity for over-running. In order to do this, they must decompose,
or return the lines back from the galley into the composing-stick, to
be rectified accordingly.

If one or more words to be inserted in a line cannot be “got in” by
changing the spaces of the line for lesser ones, part of the line must
be put back into the close of the preceding one, or forward into the
beginning of the subsequent one, or both, till room is obtained. If
the insertion be large, several lines will need to be over-run, either
backward or forward, till a break is arrived at; when, if it will not
come in, a line is to be driven out.

When an omission is to be made, the contrary course must be taken.
If it be but little, the compositor takes it out, and drives out
the remaining matter, either by enlarging her spaces, or bestowing
the beginning of the following, or the close of the preceding line
therein. If it be considerable, she may be obliged to over-run several
lines before it can be driven out.

As to the faults which escape the reader and compositor, they are
usually noted in what is called the _errata_.

The type, then, being composed and corrected in the galley, she
measures off enough for a page, ties it up with a cord, and proceeds
to the next, till all the pages required for the sheet are completed;
this being done, she carries them to the imposing or correcting stone
(see p. 33), there to range them in order in a chase. This is called
_imposing_.

The _chase_ is a rectangular iron frame of dimensions which vary
according to the size of the paper to be printed on. It has two cross
pieces of the same metal, called a _long_ and _short_ cross, mortised
at each end into the frame so that they may be moved if necessary.

By the different situations of these crosses, the chase is fitted for
different volumes; for quartos and octavos, one traverses the middle
lengthwise, the other breadthwise, so as to intersect in the centre,
which is the most customary situation; for twelves and twenty-fours,
the short cross is shifted nearer to one end of the chase. For folios,
the long cross is left entirely out, and the short one placed in the
middle; and for broadsides, or sheets printed on one side only, both
crosses are set aside.

To dress the chase, or range and fix the pages in it, a set of
furniture is made use of, consisting of reglets or slips of wood of
different dimensions, which are only about half an inch high, so as to
be lower than the letters. Some of these are placed at the top of the
pages, and are called _heads_; others between them to form the inner
margin, called _gutters_; others at the sides, called _side-sticks_;
and others at the bottom, called _foot-sticks_.

The pages then being placed in order on the stone, the chase is put
over them, the furniture applied between the pages and the chase in the
positions above mentioned; and the whole is locked up by means of small
pieces of wood, cut in wedge form, called _quoins_, which are driven
with a mallet and shooting-stick to a sufficient tightness. In this
condition, the work is called a _forme_, containing more or less pages
according to the size of the volume.

Before the forme is quite locked up, it is pressed down by passing a
smooth piece of wood, called the _planer_, over the letters, to make
their surfaces stand flat and even; and, when locked up, it is tested,
to see that nothing is loose.

As there are two formes required to every sheet, when both sides are
to be printed, it is necessary that they should be of exactly the same
length and breadth; _i.e._, the corresponding heads, gutters, &c., are
to be equal in both formes, that the pages may fall exactly on the back
of each other. This is called _register_.

Here, then, properly ends the compositor’s work; the forme, thus
finished, being ready to be committed to the pressman.

Besides the several kinds of letters and characters above mentioned,
used in printing, there are likewise rules for division lines, borders,
and head and tail-pieces, accommodated to the several kinds of letters.

The _rules_ for division lines are of brass, and are made exactly
the same height as the letter; otherwise they would hinder the
neighbouring letters from printing, or would themselves be hindered.
These the compositor occasionally cuts into proper lengths, as her work
requires.

The _borders_, or _flowers_, are a kind of ornament, in various forms,
serving for the division of books, chapters, &c. Their depth is
proportioned to the letter, and their length adjusted to the page; for
being composed of several moveable pieces, it is easy to lengthen or
shorten them.

The _head_ and _tail-pieces_, either cut in wood, or cast in type
metal, are used at the beginnings and endings of chapters or books.

The initial letters are sometimes cut in wood, and figured; sometimes
cast like the other characters.

For the convenience of binding, printers have recourse to signatures,
_i.e._, letters of the alphabet placed at the bottom of the first page
of each sheet, which show the order in which the sheets are to be
bound, as well as whether the quires are complete.

       *       *       *       *       *

And now, perhaps, you may be inclined to ask, “How long does it take a
person to learn to set up type sufficiently well to obtain employment?”

To this we would reply, that very much depends upon the age and ability
of the learner. Girls who begin young, say at the age of fifteen,
generally learn to set up fairly well in about twelve months, and then
begin to acquire speed, so that they can set from 25,000 to 30,000
letters per week.

Those who begin later, say at about twenty years of age, should be able
to do the same amount at the end of six months, for which they would
receive from twelve to fifteen shillings per week, according to the
conditions on which they enter as learners.

We have known some to earn twenty shillings per week after twelve
months’ learning, and afterwards increase to between twenty-five and
thirty shillings.

We do not mean to say that every learner would make the same progress,
as we have known many who have not; but, generally speaking, the
deficiency arises either from a want of proper education, or a lack of
anything like aptitude for business.

However, we are quite sure that persons of fair education, who make
up their minds to learn, can do so with even better results than those
we have before mentioned. It is not to be expected that a business of
this description can be learned without some amount of perseverance,
and those who take it up must be prepared to meet with difficulties and
overcome them.

For persons of more mature age there are special posts to occupy, one
of which is that of forewoman. This post requires not less than six
months’ training, in order to learn the general routine of the work.
But those who fill it must have a natural aptitude for business, and
possess those qualities which are essential in governing a number of
hands in any business. The remuneration would be higher in this case,
though much would depend upon the ability of the individual.

The post of reader is also an important one, and requires about the
same amount of training. It is essential that a reader should have a
practical knowledge of at least the rudiments of printing. Moreover,
a person filling this post must necessarily possess a large amount
of general knowledge; must be able to read a great variety of
manuscripts, and have a quick eye to detect errors. A good reader can
always obtain a high rate of remuneration.

We have now gone over the whole ground, though, perhaps, very
superficially. Our object, however, is not so much to give an
exhaustive treatise on the Art of Printing, as a general idea of
one branch of it to those who desire to learn; and only by entering
a printing office for a given time as a learner, is it possible to
acquire any useful knowledge of the business.

  APPENDIX V.


Miss Emily Faithfull wrote as follows in 1874:

In the end of 1859 our attention was directed to the printing trade
as offering a field for the employment of women, and early in the
following year the Victoria Press was opened in the face of a great and
powerful opposition,[A] and we commenced what was then considered a
rash experiment, and perhaps might have proved so, but for the liberal
support accorded by friends who appreciated the difficulties we had to
encounter from those who tried to check the movement by fair means or
foul.

[A] Mr. Gladstone in speaking on monopolies (about the date to which we
allude) observed;--“Then we come to the printer’s monopoly--a powerful
combination, which has for its first principle that no woman shall be
employed, for reasons obvious enough--viz., because women are admirably
suited for that trade, having a niceness of finger which would enable
them to handle type better than men; they are, however, excluded by the
printers’ combination.”

The opposition was not only directed against the employer, but the
female apprentices were subjected to all kinds of petty insults.
Unmanly tricks were played upon them; their frames and stools were
covered with ink so as to soil their dresses unawares, the letters were
mixed in their boxes, and their cases were emptied of “sorts.”

Nevertheless, after some years of work, in spite of foes without and
traitors within, property purposely injured, machinery wantonly broken,
&c., &c., we have steered our little bark safely through the natural
and artificial perils by which it was surrounded, and can now point to
an office in thorough working order, producing its own monthly magazine
and weekly paper, together with the books, reports of societies,
chancery bills, cards, and circulars, with which the friends of the
movement from all parts of the country kindly favour us.

Nor does the success of our experiment stop here; we gladly and
thankfully recall the fact that female compositors are now employed
in several other offices; the applications for “trained hands” are
increasing. During the last month we have received letters from
different correspondents asking us to send women compositors and proof
readers to country offices. For the women who have taken up this trade
have proved equal to their work. They “set up type” with expedition and
accuracy. We have no hesitation in saying, after our long experience,
that young girls learn with greater rapidity than boys of the same age;
they are not only more intelligent, but they are far more attentive.

They have another vantage ground which employers will not be slow to
recognise--viz., habits of sobriety. They do not ask for a few hours’
leave of absence and remain away a couple of days “on the spree,” which
too often forms the man’s excuse for placing the master printer in a
position of more or less awkwardness, according to the size of the
office.

And in one direction the introduction of women into printing offices
may prove beneficial to others as well as to themselves. This has been
tested to a great extent in America. Not only did we find women at
work in Harper’s splendid office in New York, but during a visit to
Harvard, Mr. Houghton, the proprietor of the _Riverside Press_, kindly
took us over his immense establishment, where we found men and women
at work, side by side, setting up type. He spoke not so much of the
work executed by the nimble fingers of the women, but of the moral
effects of their presence there. The men had been shamed out of the
use of bad words and habits, and he declared that it was impossible
to over rate the good achieved, adducing that in the interests of his
business nothing would induce him to have a room in which men worked
alone. And this is justly regarded as a model Press in America. It
reminds you of the good old days when the printer was a scholar. The
heads of departments are all college men. When we had concluded our
tour of inspection, and Mr. Houghton had assured us that his idea of
introducing women compositors was due to a visit he had paid to our
own Victoria Press, we indeed felt amply rewarded for any anxiety
experienced in the establishment of an office which had not only helped
English women, but actually influenced the fate of their sisters on the
other side of the Atlantic Ocean--far beyond its own immediate centre.

Female compositors can earn from 10s. to 30s., but a good reader
sometimes receives £2 2s. a week. Before anyone is qualified to
undertake this position they must spend about twelve months in learning
the technicalities of the business. Quickness of eye and a thorough
knowledge of grammar and punctuation are indispensable, but they are
not sufficient qualifications. We must be emphatic on this point, for
many ladies come to us, and think because they can detect an error in
some newspaper or magazine article, they are capable of filling the
very onerous position of a reader[B] in a printing office.

[B] Several ladies have applied for a readership in a printing office
lately vacant, stating as their qualification a capacity for reading
aloud; another lady stated that “she knew she could undertake it
for her father was a solicitor, and she had often copied out legal
documents.”

Unfortunately, few ladies ever think, or are allowed to think, of
preparing themselves for work; they never dream of it until driven
to take it up for self support, and then require immediate payment.
Now, charity cannot find an enduring place in the labour market,
consequently women cannot be placed in positions of trust and
respectability simply because they need remuneration, and those
who desire to undertake any work in connexion with printing must be
prepared to train themselves.

In confirmation of the opinions we have expressed about the position
of a proof reader, we quote the following observation from a
practical printer, who has always been friendly to the movement,
and is a recognised authority on this point. He writes in answer
to our enquiry:--“There _must_ be a previous acquaintance with
practical printing. A very few people will do without it, but they
are exceptions. By rights, there ought to be three or four years’
experience as a compositor first. Then a few months under careful
supervision may make a reader.”

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the
United States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation.”

• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
  works.

• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you “AS-IS”, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
